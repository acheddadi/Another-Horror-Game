[6:07 PM] Geostegma: What kind of story do you think would be compelling enough to send someone exploring into dark depths?
[6:08 PM] Geostegma: I was thinking something going wrong on a space voyage and having the protagonist wake up in the middle of the mission
[6:08 PM] Geostegma: Just sounds a little too cliche though
[6:14 PM] KhaosRivy: Yeah, that is a common niche. But there are things that can be done with that, to keep it from being like the others. 
Humm. :thinking: Could keep to the space voyage, but instead of waking up in the middle of a mission, someone in 'modern' time could come across the ship so to speak, like in the woods. Based on rumours of missing persons of unexplainable circumstances..
[6:14 PM] Geostegma: Ouuh I like that!
[6:15 PM] Geostegma: I'd like to stay clear from aliens, I prefer the undead and how uncanny they can look
[6:15 PM] Geostegma: Maybe an infection spread on the ship? A foreign alien virus?
[6:17 PM] Geostegma: The whole crew having been experience symptoms of dementia all mutilated each other, and were stuck in space in a drift for an unknown amount of time ... eventually making their way into the present time and crash landing?
[6:17 PM] Geostegma: experiencing*
[6:18 PM] KhaosRivy: That would work too!
[6:18 PM] KhaosRivy: Actually, that sounds quite pleasant.
[6:19 PM] KhaosRivy: Could take some inspiration from Half-Life actually, sort of like the 'headcrab' sort of ideal, that twists the mind.
A realistic and real-life example is actual brain-effecting parasites
[6:20 PM] Geostegma: Oooh yeah, but those little creatures should probably only manifest themselves later in the game so as to keep the player confused as to why these humanoid creatures exist or are hostile towards them
[6:21 PM] Geostegma: What I'm wondering is why would the protagonist walk into a death trap, what incentive do they have for exploring an abandoned ship?
[6:21 PM] Geostegma: Say that people are missing, why not just contact the police?
[6:29 PM] KhaosRivy: That is a good question!

Those kinda questions are the biggest part. But a few ways could be taken, accidently stumbling. They injure themselves in the woods, are mistaken for a 'host/vessel' and then end up on the ship. That is one way, typical kidnap. 

A lot of things are 'why not just contact the police'  in many horror games.
[6:39 PM] KhaosRivy: As thats generally people's first thoughts, but thats not always the available case.
[6:53 PM] Geostegma: Sorry I was cooking
[6:55 PM] Geostegma: Yeah you're right, it's still a good base for me to start working, I guess the details can be figured out later
[6:55 PM] Geostegma: So in terms of length of the game, since I was thinking of something that could be beat in 30 minutes to 1 hour, should the ending be left open ended?
[7:01 PM] KhaosRivy: That would be cool, but gotta be careful with open-ended games. If it doesn't have a proper 'climax' point, the ending may be dry..
[7:01 PM] Geostegma: Hmm
[7:01 PM] Geostegma: I see
[7:02 PM] Geostegma: Say that the protagonist is a young girl looking for her little brother who was lost in the woods, and thought she heard his voice coming from inside the ship
[7:03 PM] Geostegma: I'm thinking that the twist could be that the younger brother had been dead all along, and that his corpse had actually been embodied by a creature who could speak for him, and had access to his memories
[7:05 PM] Geostegma: what if we gave the player a choice, either kill their brother, because he is not longer human, or still cling on to the idea that he might still be in there, which would have the player die in the end
[7:05 PM] Geostegma: no longer*
[7:06 PM] Geostegma: Actually I don't see why the sister would have access to a gun
[7:06 PM] Geostegma: Maybe a mother instead?
[7:06 PM] Geostegma: pulls the gun out of her glovebox?
[7:07 PM] Geostegma: Hmm but then why would there be bullets matching her handgun on the ship?
[7:11 PM] KhaosRivy: Hehe, the joys of game development.

How about this, Wife of a Cop, which explains the gun. One of her children goes missing, or has been missing and there is rumors of a child kidnapper in the area, which is a guise/cover to the actual issue at hand. She wanders into the woods where there is a rumored 'shack' of this person, she gets injured and ends up in this ship location. Why are there matching bullets for the gun? Perhaps some of the 'work-force' for the police had gone missing and their supplies are found on the ship scattered about.
[7:12 PM] Geostegma: Genius!
[7:12 PM] Geostegma: But should be the wife of a dead cop
[7:12 PM] Geostegma: :smile:
[7:12 PM] KhaosRivy: Ooo.
[7:14 PM] Geostegma: Thanks for all the help, this is really great stuff. Now I already know what the first level I will need to design will be
[7:15 PM] KhaosRivy: Awesome, happy to help! :smile:

thoughts: car crash, young mother, blah blah
